Question 2: Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default. To demonstrate this, we can use Pythonâ€™s `threading` module to print the current thread of the signal handler and compare it to the thread of the calling code.

Here's a simple code snippet to demonstrate this:

# models.py
import threading
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

# Signal handler
@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal handler is running in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

# Usage example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Caller is running in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
    obj = MyModel(name="Test")
    obj.save()

Expected Output:


Caller is running in thread: MainThread
Signal handler is running in thread: MainThread


Explanation:
- The 'obj.save()' method triggers the 'post_save' signal.
- Both the caller (the code saving the model) and the signal handler print the name of the current thread.
- Since both print statements show 'MainThread', this conclusively proves that the signal runs in the same thread as the caller.

Conclusion:
By default, Django signals run in the same thread as the calling code.
